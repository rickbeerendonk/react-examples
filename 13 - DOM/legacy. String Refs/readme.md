# String Refs

## Deprecated

[String Refs are deprecated](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#legacy-api-string-refs) because it has problems:

- Makes React a bit slower due to extra administration.
- It doesn't work as most people would expect in some scenarios.
- It is not composable.
